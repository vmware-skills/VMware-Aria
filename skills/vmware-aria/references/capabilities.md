# Capabilities

## Automation Level Reference

Each operation is classified by autonomy level per the Enterprise Harness Engineering framework. **vmware-aria is heavily L1/L2 (34 read / 10 write)** — primarily a monitoring and analysis skill.

| Level | Meaning | Agent autonomy | Examples in this skill |
|:-:|---|---|---|
| **L1** | Read-only, raw data | Always auto-run | `list_resources`, `get_resource`, `get_resource_metrics`, `list_metric_keys`, `get_resource_properties`, `get_resource_relationships`, `list_alerts`, `get_alert`, `list_alert_definitions`, `list_alert_notes`, `list_maintenance_schedules`, `get_aria_node_resources`, `list_adapters`, capacity / badge queries |
| **L2** | Read + analysis / recommendation | Always auto-run | `investigate_alert` (alert → confirmed affected resource), `get_alert_recommendations` (alert → definition state → prioritized recommendations), anomaly counts, top-N consumer ranking, capacity trend forecasting, rightsizing recommendations |
| **L3** | Single write — user must approve | Only after explicit confirmation | `acknowledge_alert` (via takeownership action), `cancel_alert`, `create_alert_definition`, `set_alert_definition_state`, `delete_alert_definition`, `generate_report`, `delete_report`, `start_resource_maintenance`, `end_resource_maintenance`, `add_alert_note` *(the only writes; all auditable. `add_alert_note` is low risk and has no `confirmed` gate on MCP — a note changes neither the alert nor monitoring; the CLI still asks once)* |
| **L4** | Multi-step plan / apply workflow | *N/A currently* | — *(no multi-step orchestration; Aria is observe/analyze, not configure)* |
| **L5** | Auto-remediation from learned pattern | Pattern library only; requires `risk:low` + `reversible:true` + `repeatable:true` | *(roadmap — candidates: auto-acknowledge known-noisy alerts, auto-cancel resolved-by-event alerts)* |

**Notes**:
- L1/L2 tools are always safe for agents to call without confirmation.
- L3 alert-state writes pass through the `@vmware_tool` decorator: connection check → policy check → audit log. Cancel is irreversible by Aria API design and treated as a destructive operation.
- For VM/host operations see [vmware-aiops](https://github.com/vmware-skills/VMware-AIops); Aria recommendations are advisory, not actuating.

## What vmware-aria Can Do

### Resource Monitoring

- **List any resource type**: VirtualMachine, HostSystem, ClusterComputeResource, Datastore, Datacenter, ResourcePool
- **Filter by name**: substring match across any resource list
- **Find objects that stopped reporting**: every row carries `aria_state` (Aria's lifecycle state — `STARTED` for a powered-off VM too) and `collection_status` (`DATA_RECEIVING`, `NO_DATA_RECEIVING`, …; null when not reported). `collection_status="NO_DATA_RECEIVING"` with `resource_kind="all"` lists the objects behind "Objects are not receiving data from adapter instance"; a filter that matches nothing returns a `note` naming the statuses seen
- **Get resource details**: health, risk, and efficiency badges plus all identifiers
- **Fetch metric time series**: any metric key with configurable time window and rollup (AVG/MAX/MIN). Keys with no points are listed under `missing` with a reason (`not_collected_for_resource` with `similar_keys`, `no_data_in_window`, `resource_reports_no_stat_keys`, `undetermined` — also when stat-key rows are in an unrecognised form) instead of silently vanishing. `similar_keys` holds at most 10 keys, only ones `sanitize()` leaves unchanged and at most 200 characters long
- **Look up metric keys**: `list_metric_keys` lists the keys one resource actually reports, joined with its kind's definitions for name and unit. Each row's `definition` is `found`, `found_by_instance` (an instanced key such as `guestfilesystem:/boot|usage` joined to `guestfilesystem|usage`), `not_defined_for_kind` (also listed in `unjoined_keys`) or `not_read` (the definitions could not be read: `definitions_status: undetermined`, name and unit unknown, not absent). With `resource_kind` instead, it lists the keys the kind defines — a defined key is not collected on every resource. A nonexistent resource id is an HTTP 404 error, not an empty list
- **Read properties**: `get_resource_properties` — current `{name, value}` rows sorted by name (power state, `summary|parentHost`, configured CPU and memory, `config|extraConfig|*` flags), filtered by a name substring. Configuration facts, not time series
- **Walk relationships**: `get_resource_relationships` — related resources with `id`, `name`, `kind`, `adapter_kind` and `direction` (`parent` / `child` / `both` / `other`). `relationship_type` is exactly ALL, PARENT or CHILD; ANCESTOR and DESCENDANT are refused (Aria Operations 8.18.7 answers HTTP 400 for them), so walk PARENT one level at a time. With ALL, `direction` is null and `direction_note` says why when the PARENT/CHILD lists could not be read
- **Find top consumers**: rank VMs or hosts by a metric's last-hour average (`value`, 5-minute AVG rollup — what Aria ranks by, descending; `latest_value` is the most recent point). Resources with no data for the key are left out, not ranked at zero; `excluded_no_data` counts the ones the ranking listed with no points, and `hint` says when that shortened the list — when they took slots of a full `top_n`, the result is `truncated` and `hint` says to raise `top_n`

### Alert Management

- **List active or all alerts**: filter by criticality (INFORMATION/WARNING/IMMEDIATE/CRITICAL) or resource. The Alert model has no resource name, so each row's `resource_name` and `resource_kind` are resolved in one batched `/resources` lookup per page; `null` means unknown, and `resource_names_note` says how many could not be retrieved (a failed lookup, or an appliance that ignored the id filter), were not returned, or have no name in Aria Operations
- **Inspect alert details**: contributing (triggered) symptoms from the dedicated contributingsymptoms endpoint, plus timeline. A symptom that carries no name or severity (every symptom on Aria Operations 8.18.7) takes both from its symptom definition, fetched in one batched `/symptomdefinitions` lookup; `definition_lookup` and `symptom_definitions_note` say when that did not work, including symptoms with no definition id to look up. Recommendations are attached to the alert definition, not the alert
- **Investigate an alert end-to-end**: `investigate_alert` resolves an alert to its affected resource in one call — fetches the alert, reads `resourceId`, fetches that resource, confirms name and kind, and returns both UUIDs *explicitly labelled* plus a ready-to-use handoff naming the exact vmware-monitor tool and argument. Use it instead of chaining `get_alert` → `get_resource` by hand: the two UUIDs are different objects and a small model will otherwise swap them. An unresolvable resource degrades to a warning plus explicit nulls rather than losing the alert
- **Acknowledge alerts**: mark as seen without closing (control state → ACKNOWLEDGED)
- **Alert notes**: `list_alert_notes` returns an alert's notes (`note`, `type` USER / SYSTEM, `user_name`, `created_time_ms`); an unknown alert id is HTTP 404, and a set `notes_note` means the notes are unknown, not absent. `add_alert_note` records who is handling the alert or what was done — it does not change status or ownership (use `acknowledge_alert`), is not idempotent (two calls add two notes) and has no undo. `created: null` with `confirmation_note` means Aria did not confirm the note: run `list_alert_notes` before retrying
- **Alert recommendations**: `get_alert_recommendations` resolves the alert to its alert definition, uses the state whose severity matches the alert's criticality (else the definition's only state, else every state merged at each recommendation's highest priority, with a `note`), and returns the recommendations sorted by priority (lower is more important) with description and action. `status`: `found`; `partial` (some text could not be read — `description: null` is unknown, not blank); `none_defined` (`recommendations: []`); `unknown` (the definition could not be read — `recommendations: null`, never "no recommendations"). On Aria Operations 8.18.7 a CRITICAL vCenter-app alert returned 7 prioritized recommendations
- **Cancel alerts**: permanently dismiss (status → CANCELLED)
- **Browse alert definitions**: the templates that define when alerts fire

### Capacity Planning

- **Cluster capacity overview**: group-level remaining-capacity percentage plus per-dimension (cpu/mem/diskspace) headroom and days-until-full (the percentage metric only exists at group level)
- **Remaining capacity**: how much more CPU, memory, disk can be added before hitting limits
- **Time remaining**: predicted days until each capacity dimension is exhausted (based on trend)
- **Rightsizing recommendations**: identify over-provisioned VMs (reclaim resources) and under-provisioned VMs (prevent degradation). Raw recommendations are MHz / KB / GB (`recommended_units`); `recommended_vcpus` converts CPU with the VM's own MHz per vCPU. `cpu_direction` / `memory_direction` compare against the current configuration (memory within 1% is `right_sized`). Powered-off VMs and templates are listed but never `actionable`, nor is a VM whose power state or template flag is unknown. If the VM property read fails, the property-derived fields are null, no row is actionable, and `properties_note` names the failure. `caveats` flag engine disagreement and vendor minimum sizes before any reduction. `recommendation_range` gives the daily low and high of each recommendation over the last 7 days with `days_with_data`; a CPU or memory range wider than 5% of its high makes `recommendation_stable` false and the row not actionable. Null when no history came back; `history_note` names a failed history read

### Resource Maintenance

- **Start maintenance**: `start_resource_maintenance` stops Aria alerting on one resource and collecting its data. With `duration_minutes` (1–525600) or `end_time_ms` (epoch milliseconds, in the future) the resource is `MAINTAINED` for that window and returns to its prior state when it expires; pass one, not both. With neither it is `MAINTAINED_MANUAL` until ended. Returns `requested`, `before` / `after` state, `confirmed` (true / false / null — null means the after-state could not be read, which is unknown, not failure) and `note`. On MCP the default `confirmed=False` returns a preview without connecting. Risk medium; audited with the before and after state; undo is `end_resource_maintenance`, recorded only when the resource was known not to be in maintenance before (so an undo never closes a window this call did not open)
- **End maintenance**: `end_resource_maintenance` refuses only a resource known not to be in maintenance (an adapter reports a state such as `STARTED` or `STOPPED`); when the state is unknown — it cannot be read, or an adapter reports `UNKNOWN` / `NONE` — it proceeds and `before` says unknown. Risk medium, audited. Its undo, recorded only when the resource was known to be in maintenance, re-enters manual maintenance — the end of a timed window is not restored
- **Maintenance schedules**: `list_maintenance_schedules` — name, schedule type (ONCE / DAILY / WEEKLY / MONTHLY / YEARLY), recurrence, start hour and minute, duration in minutes, time zone, start and expiry. A schedule does not list its resources; pass `resource_id` for the schedules of one resource. A set `schedules_note` means the schedules are unknown, not absent

### Anomaly Detection

- **List anomalies**: per-resource Total Anomalies counts (`System Attributes|total_alarms` metric — active symptoms, events, and DT violations on the object and its children), optionally scoped to one resource. The UI's anomalous-metrics list is not part of the public API
- **Risk badge**: composite risk score (0–100) from the resource's `badges[]` array — predicts likelihood of future problems; for contributing causes inspect the resource's active alerts

### Platform Health

- **Aria health check**: `assessment` HEALTHY / DEGRADED / DOWN / UNKNOWN from the node status plus the per-service breakdown, and the product version and line (8.x / 9.x). The node reports OFFLINE whenever any one service is not running, so OFFLINE with some services OK is DEGRADED, not down. An ONLINE node whose per-service breakdown could not be read is HEALTHY with `details` saying no service was checked individually; a service in a state other than OK or ERROR makes it UNKNOWN unless DEGRADED. An unreadable version or service list is reported (`version_error` / `services_error`), not raised
- **Collector group status**: list collector groups (member IDs) enriched with each collector's name, UP/DOWN state, and local flag
- **Aria node resources**: `get_aria_node_resources` reads Aria's own self-monitoring objects (`vC-Ops-Node`, `vC-Ops-Watchdog`): per node memory (`mem|total`, `mem|used`, `mem|free`, `mem|actualFree`, `mem|actualUsed`), swap, heap overall and per component, and watchdog restarts per service. Each value has `latest`, `unit` (from Aria's statkey definitions, never assumed) and `window` min / avg / max / points over `window_hours` (1–720, default 24) of 5-minute averages. `memory_pressure.level` is an indicator: HIGH when actual free memory is below 10% of total, ELEVATED below 20%, NORMAL at 20% or more, UNKNOWN when the readings do not settle it. A key with no value is in the node's `missing` list (`not_reported` / `no_data` / `undetermined`), never zeroed; `watchdog_restarts: null` is unknown, not zero. On Aria Operations 8.18.7 after a memory upgrade the node read `mem|total` 15.61 GB (was 7.75), actual free 41%, pressure NORMAL, and 9 watchdog services with 0 restarts
- **Adapter collection state**: `list_adapters` — each adapter instance's kind, collector, monitoring interval, resources and metrics collected, last collected and last heartbeat with ages in seconds, its own message, and `stale`: true when the last collection is older than max(3 × monitoring interval, 15 minutes), false within that, null when the fields cannot support a verdict (`stale_basis` shows the arithmetic). Ages use the appliance clock from node status when it is available (`reference_clock`). An empty or unrecognised answer is an error, never "no adapters". A recent collection does not prove every object behind the adapter receives data. On Aria Operations 8.18.7 all 6 adapters were not stale

## List Result Envelope

Every list-returning tool wraps its rows in the family envelope
(`vmware_policy.paginated`) rather than returning a bare array, so an agent can
tell a complete answer from page one instead of guessing (VMware-AIops issue
#31). Keys: `items`, `returned`, `limit`, `total`, `truncated`, `hint` — always
all six, with explicit `null` where a value is unknown.

`total` is only populated where the suite-api genuinely reports a collection
size. It is never inferred:

| Tool | `total` source | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| `list_resources` | `pageInfo.totalCount` on `GET /resources` | Suppressed under `name_filter` — that filter is client-side, so the server's count describes the unfiltered kind |
| `list_alert_definitions` | `pageInfo.totalCount` on `GET /alertdefinitions` | Suppressed under `name_filter` |
| `list_symptom_definitions` | `pageInfo.totalCount` on `GET /symptomdefinitions` | `resource_kind` is a server-side param, so it is reflected in the count; suppressed under `name_filter` |
| `list_report_definitions` | `pageInfo.totalCount` on `GET /reportdefinitions` | Suppressed under `name_filter` |
| `list_reports` | Count of matches from the unpaged `GET /reports` | The whole matching set is in hand, so the count is exact |
| `list_rightsizing_recommendations` | VM `pageInfo.totalCount` from the candidate `GET /resources` | One row per VM evaluated, so the count describes the same collection |
| `list_anomalies` | Count of flagged objects on a complete scan; VM `pageInfo.totalCount` when the scan hit its cap | Also carries `scanned`, `vm_total`, `scan_complete`. `limit` bounds the answer, not the scan. Only flagged VMs are returned, so a short list is not evidence of a clean environment |
| `list_alerts` | — | `POST /alerts/query` reports no count; a full page is conservatively flagged truncated |
| `get_top_consumers` | — | A top-N ranking is a slice of an unbounded set |
| `list_collector_groups` | — | `GET /collectorgroups` is unpaged and takes no limit, so `truncated` is always `false` |
| `list_adapters` | Count of matches from the unpaged `GET /adapters` | Exact; the `adapter_kind` filter is applied client-side and reflected in the count |
| `list_metric_keys` | Count of rows after `key_filter` from the unpaged statkeys read | Exact |
| `get_resource_properties` | Count of rows after `name_filter` from the unpaged `GET /resources/{id}/properties` | Exact |
| `get_resource_relationships` | Count of related resources from a complete walk of the paged relationships endpoint | `null` only when the walk hit its safety cap (`direction_note` says so) |
| `list_maintenance_schedules` | `pageInfo.totalCount` on `GET /maintenanceschedules` | `null` when the API reports no size; a set `schedules_note` means `items` is unknown, not empty |
| `list_alert_notes` | `pageInfo.totalCount` on `GET /alerts/{id}/notes` | `null` when the API reports no size; a set `notes_note` means `items` is unknown, not empty |

The six tools added above also return `next_offset`: pass it back as `offset`
and stop when it is `null`.

CLI commands unwrap `items` and print the rows; the envelope is the MCP/library
contract.

Reading rules for an agent:

- **Rows live under `items`.** An empty `items` with `returned: 0` means the query genuinely matched nothing — report that, not a tool failure.
- **`truncated: true` means more rows exist.** Never describe it as the complete set; say it is partial or re-query with a higher `limit` or a narrower filter, as `hint` says.
- **`truncated: false` means the answer is complete.**
- **`total: null` means the API reported no collection size**, so a page filled exactly to the limit is flagged truncated conservatively; a follow-up with a larger limit settles it.
- **`list_anomalies`**: `limit` bounds the answer, not the scan — the environment is ranked in full and the worst `limit` objects returned. Only VMs with a non-zero count are returned, so a short list is not evidence of a clean environment. With `scan_complete: true`, `total` is the number of anomalous objects; with `scan_complete: false` the scan hit its cap, `total` is the VM count, and a `note` says the ranking is partial.

## Aria Operations / VCF Operations Version Compatibility

| Feature | Minimum Version |
|---------|----------------|
| VCF Operations 9.1 (VCF 9.1) | ✅ All tools; PromQL uses the 9.1 VODAP service (base path inferred, not yet verified on real hardware). Aria Operations was rebranded VCF Operations in VCF 9. |
| VCF Operations 9.0 (VCF 9.0) | ✅ suite-api tools plus fleet certificates / passwords / domains and diagnostic findings |
| Aria Operations 8.x | ✅ suite-api tools. Fleet, findings and PromQL are 9.0+: on 8.x they return a "requires VCF Operations 9.0 or newer" error naming the version the appliance reports |
| Token authentication | 6.6+ |
| Resource metrics stats query | 6.7+ |
| Rightsizing recommendations | 7.0+ |
| Anomaly detection | 7.5+ |
| Suite API v2 paths used | 8.0+ |

Endpoints are checked against the vROps 8.6 and VCF Operations 9.1 API indexes in `tests/eval/spec/`. Live-verified on Aria Operations 8.18.7 (2026-09): resources, metrics, alerts and symptoms, rightsizing, health, doctor, node resources, adapters, alert recommendations, and reads of maintenance schedules and alert notes (none existed).
